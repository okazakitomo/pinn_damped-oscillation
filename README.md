This repository provides sample codes of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) by using damped oscillations as an example.

**Prerequisites:** <br>
- Programming Language: Python 3 <br>
- Libraries: PyTorch, Numpy, Matplotlib

By running the codes in the default settings, data preparation, PINN training and inference, and visualization of results are performed. The results are stored in the corresponding folders.

An instruction text written in Japanese is also provided.
